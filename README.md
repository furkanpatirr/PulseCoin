# PulseCoin Mobile üìàüì∞

> **Early-stage repository** for an Android app that delivers real-time cryptocurrency news with on-device sentiment scores and custom alerts.

---

## Why?

Staying ahead in volatile crypto markets means catching market-moving news the moment it drops.  
This app will stream headlines pushed from our backend pipeline (Kafka + CryptoBERT) and notify users when sentiment or price thresholds are breached.

---

## High-Level Goals (v0)

- Jetpack Compose UI with clean, modular architecture  
- Firebase Auth for sign-in, FCM for push alerts  
- Room cache for offline browsing  
- Simple, dark-mode first design
